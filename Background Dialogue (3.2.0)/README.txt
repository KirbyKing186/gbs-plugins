Description-
Background Dialogue is an event plugin that allows you to easily make dialogue boxes using backgrounds in GB Studio. It's suitable for making standalone visual novel style scenes and cutscenes. Features include:
-Positionable name tags
-Multiple boxes of positionable dialogue
-Automatic line spacing
-Prompt when dialogue is complete (uses bottom right tile of font)
Please note, if you want to use multiple fonts in your background dialogue, you must include them in a regular Display Dialogue event elsewhere in your project. It doesn't actually need to be called, but it must be present for the compiler to add the fonts to the ROM.

Installation instructions-
Create a folder called 'plugins' inside the root folder of your GB Studio project.
Add the 'Background Dialogue' folder that contains this readme file to the 'plugins' folder.
Compile your game.
